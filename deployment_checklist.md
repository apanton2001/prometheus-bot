## 6. v0 Function Configuration

- [ ] Verify all v0 functions have correct entry points
- [ ] Check memory limits and timeouts on compute-heavy functions
- [ ] Set up regional deployments for low-latency functions
- [ ] Configure error logging for v0 functions
- [ ] Set up proper CORS headers if needed

## 7. Vercel Project Configuration

  - [ ] Build Command: `npm run build`
  - [ ] Output Directory: `.next`
  - [ ] Install Command: `npm install`
- [ ] Add all environment variables to Vercel project

## 8. Deployment Steps

- [ ] Perform initial deployment to staging environment
- [ ] Verify build completes successfully
- [ ] Check all pages and functionality on staging

## Rollback Plan

In case of deployment issues:

1. Identify the problem and determine if rollback is necessary
2. Rollback to previous deployment via Vercel dashboard
3. Check database state and verify data integrity
4. Communicate status to team and stakeholders
5. Address issues in development environment
6. Plan and schedule new deployment
